# Bits

## Description:

Bits provides a system to successfully sustain habits using the concepts of the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear

### Background Info:

Habits are very hard to build for the long-term because results are not seen immediately.
People make a few small changes, and fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop.

Instead of focusing on goals (results you want to achieve), focus on systems (processes that lead to those results).

  - Focus on the 3 types of responses (bronze, silver, gold)

- **Add more options for craving and reward steps:**

  - ex. Accountability partners
  - ex. Join a culture where your desired behavior is the norm

- **Incorporate other concepts from book:**

  - Outcome-based habits VS Identity-based habits
  - Problem phase (cue, craving) and solution phase (response, reward)

- **Incorporate a system for destroying bad habits (habit detonator):**

  - 1. Make it invisible
  - 2. Make it unattractive
  - 3. Make it difficult
  - 4. Make it unsatisfying

- **Incorporate a habit tracking system:**

  - Users would be able to track their habits daily and which response they did for that day (bronze, silver, or gold)

- **When a habit is created or updated, redirect the user to that specific habit:**

  - It currently redirects to /habitgenerator

- **Add useRef for form validation:**

  - Right now, the habit form can be submitted even if all the inputs are blank

- **Improve the navbar styling:**

- **Improve the app for mobile screens:**

  - Make {user.name}'s Habits its own line or remove it completely for mobile screens

- Add examples of common habits (ex. exercise, read, etc.) for new users
